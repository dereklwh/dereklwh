### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University, where I'm completing a B.Sc. Joint Major in Information Systems in Business Administration and Computing Science. I am passionate about the intersection of business and technology, and I am always seeking opportunities that will stimulate my personal growth. I have a keen interest in exploring cutting-edge technologies and understanding their potential influence on society, both now and in the future.

- **ðŸ”­ Currently Seeking**: I'm actively looking for co-op opportunities in software development and data analysis. I'm eager to apply my skills in a practical setting and contribute to meaningful projects.

- **ðŸ’¬ Let's Talk About**: Mechanical keyboards! If you're interested in the world of custom-built keyboards, switch types, or keycap designs, I'd be delighted to discuss this hobby with you.

- **âš¡ Fun Fact**: I had the incredible opportunity to study abroad at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and traveled across Southeast Asia during my time there. This experience not only broadened my academic horizons but also enriched my cultural understanding and global perspective.
