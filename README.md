### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University, where I'm completing a B.Sc. Joint Major in Information Systems in Business Administration and Computing Science. I am passionate about the intersection of business and technology, and I love personal development. 
<!--
- **ðŸ“š Currently Learning**: I am currently learning React and full stack development!

- **ðŸ’¬ Let's Talk About**: Mechanical keyboards! If you're interested in the world of custom-built keyboards, switch types, or keycap designs, I'd be delighted to discuss this hobby with you.

- **âš¡ Fun Fact**: I had the incredible opportunity to study abroad at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and traveled across Southeast Asia during my time there. This experience not only broadened my academic horizons but also enriched my cultural understanding and global perspective.
